#  Guidance:
#  Comments made by hash symbol are not interactive and moustly contain some explanation or theory
#  Other coments by set of triple double quotes """some code""" are interactive part of code you can play with
#  Be aware that they Always! go in paires so to comment/uncomment code you need to keep that in your mind.


#  To "install" NumPy go to "Tools" -> "Packages" -> Numpy -> install

# import numpy as np # importing NumPy



# The following code will contain a range of exercises using NumPy, 
# it is recommended that you start at the top and work your way down in stages to help support your development 


# Task 01 - Create an array
# using NumPy, create an array wich contains the below numbers, you should print this out the screen in ordre to test
# [1 4 6 8 7 2 3 9 10 13 5]

# Displaying odd numbers
# Using the array you've created, display only odd numbers that are within the array e.g.
# [1 7 3 9 13 5]

# creating a Matrix
# Create an identity matrix with the dimentions of 4*4. The below shows the example output of this:
# [[1 0 0 0
#   0 1 0 0
#   0 0 1 0
#   0 0 0 1]]

# Mathmatical Arrays
# Within the following challenges (all labelled Math #value), use the below code at the start:

#"""
# Imports NumPy in order to be used
import numpy as np

# Creates an array of data
randomArray = np.array([[1005, 2154, 1123,6524],
                        [1136, 8874, 4665, 4785],
                        [3365, 9564, 4474, 5632],
                        [1111, 3354, 6625, 2247],
                        [1679, 4652, 6431, 1465]])
#""" 

# Math #1
# Display the avarage of the above array

# Math #2
# Start by displaying the numbers within the 3rd column with this array.
# Using these values, provide the avarage value of the third column within this array
# Display this value to 2 decimal places

# Math #3
# Provide the avarage value of the first 2 rows withing this array. 

# Math #4
# Provide the minimum and maximun value withing this array

# NumPy Challenge Scenario:
#
# Student Grade Tracker
# 
# 15 students have been provided with grades the max mar avaliable is 100.
# Allow for the user to put these values into a NumPy array.
# 
# Once this has been completed, you will need to comlete the following using this dataset:
#   • Work out the minimum, maximun and avarange grade.
#   • Sort the grades in ascending order
#   • All points will be provided with 2 extra marks, display the output for this.
#   * Display the tpo three  and lowest three grades scored.
# Also if you can save and retrieve this data back from a file after you have used it.
